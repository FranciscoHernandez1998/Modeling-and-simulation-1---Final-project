## Final project - Airline company

## Description
An airline company has load airplane that receives payment proposals for the shipment of several clients. The weights and how much they are willing to pay for the shipment is sent by the clients. There is a weight restriction for the airplane which is 500. The goal is to optimize the payment and maximize the earnings.

The list of packages is the next:

| ID | Weight | Payment |
|----|--------|---------|
| 1  | 55     | 70      |
| 2  | 31     | 32      |
| 3  | 43     | 36      |
| 4  | 23     | 65      |
| 5  | 48     | 49      |
| 6  | 40     | 62      |
| 7  | 53     | 25      |
| 8  | 54     | 47      |
| 9  | 39     | 78      |
| 10 | 77     | 65      |
| 11 | 39     | 23      |
| 12 | 59     | 45      |
| 13 | 53     | 43      |
| 14 | 28     | 44      |
| 15 | 71     | 71      |
| 16 | 36     | 67      |
| 17 | 62     | 48      |
| 18 | 30     | 36      |
| 19 | 48     | 76      |
| 20 | 42     | 2       |

The job to do was to give the airline company the list of packages to accept for optimal performance.

The solution was found with

- Genetic algorithms
- Simulated annealing
